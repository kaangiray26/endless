## What is Endless?
Endless is a social media curator that allows you to view all of your favorite websites in one place with a unified card-based interface. It allows for users to upvote, save and comment on posts from websites even if the website doesn't support it.

## How to contribute?
You can contribute to Endless by adding support for new websites or by improving the existing codebase. If you want to add support for a new website, take a look at the existing extractors. Usually, each website has its own extractor with two methods inside the [extractors](https://github.com/kaangiray26/endless/tree/main/extractors) directory. If you want to improve the existing codebase, you can do so by creating a pull request.

## Extractors
Take a look at the [extractor list](list.json) below to see which websites are supported at the moment.

Prebuilt versions of the extractors are also located in the [min](https://github.com/kaangiray26/endless/tree/main/min) directory.
* For example: [Hacker News](min/hacker-news.min.js)
